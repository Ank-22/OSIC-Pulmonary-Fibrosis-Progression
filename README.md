### Description

Imagine one day, your breathing became consistently labored and shallow. Months later you were finally diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, a disorder with no known cause and no known cure, created by scarring of the lungs. If that happened to you, you would want to know your prognosis. That’s where a troubling disease becomes frightening for the patient: outcomes can range from long-term stability to rapid deterioration, but doctors aren’t easily able to tell where an individual may fall on that spectrum. Your help, and data science, may be able to aid in this prediction, which would dramatically help both patients and clinicians.

### Code Requirements

### FVC (Forced Vital Capacity)
FVC measurement shows the amount of air a person can forcefully and quickly exhale after taking a deep breath. It is defined as the recorded lung capacity in ml under the Data tab. The change in FVC over the course of weeks is used for predicting the patients' lung function decline.

Even though the FVC predictions smaller than 1000 are clipped, the minimum value in training set is 827. The maximum FVC value in training set is 6399. The distribution is heavily tailed on the right end because some patients have extremely high FVC measurements. However, most of the patients are close to mean FVC.
